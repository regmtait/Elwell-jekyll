Carefully researched over a period of 25 years, the book offers an entertaining view of Elwell's life and background—watch out for other gifted members of the Elwell family!—as well as a galaxy of over 140 large­ format colour plates representing his work in all its variety. A very readable analysis accompanies each painting for your enjoyment. The book is luxuriously printed, bound and stitched, and written with scholarship and attention to detail, yet in a style that carries you along. Elwell's own warm and humorous character, wit and natural charm shine out from its pages.
