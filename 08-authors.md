## Wendy Loncaster

The leading authority on Fred Elwell and a popular writer since being awarded an Open University first-class honours degree in the History of Art in 1988, in 1993 Wendy researched for a book and exhibition, <cite>Fred Elwell, RA &mdash; A Life in Art</cite>. This was seen by 70,000 visitors at the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull before going on to the Laing Gallery, Newcastle. It was followed by a further book and exhibition of Fred’s wife, <cite>Mary D. Elwell SWA – Stepping from the Shadows</cite> in 2001.

In 2008 Wendy collaborated with Malcolm about a talented Hull artist in <cite>Walter Goodin – Above All, the Sky</cite>, accompanied by an exhibition of the same name at the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull. The exhibition later moved to the Beverley Art Gallery, before travelling to Sewerby Hall, Bridlington.

## Malcolm Shields

Educated at Hymers College and Hull College of Commerce. Lectured in numismatics, specialising in Celtic Britain and Roman Occupation. A lifetime's interest in the Hull School of Marine Painters and the East Riding of Yorkshire Artists led him to become a recognised authority on the subject. Has for many years assisted and encouraged contemporary artists and writers.

In 2008 Malcolm co-authored with Wendy the Walter Goodin project <cite>[Walter Goodin – Above All, the Sky]</cite>.

<p>The authors are very appreciative of the scores of lovely letters received from readers of <cite>Fred Elwell RA – A Life in Art</cite> and wish to thank all with warmest gratitude. They are especially thrilled that someone felt so moved he sent the following delightful poem. It encapsulates in few words the essence of Fred&rsquo;s art.</p>

<p>To Wendy and Malcolm</p>

<cite>&ldquo;Of all the artists on my watch<br>
Just one retains a Magic touch,<br>
Landscapes, Portraits, Social Scenes<br>
Fred Elwell Knew what Painting means.<br>
The Glory of artistic might<br>
his total Mastery of light.&rdquo;
