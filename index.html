<p>Born in Beverley, East Yorkshire, Elwell enjoyed a long and active career, extending from the dazzle of Belle Époque Antwerp and Paris to the bleakness of post­war Britain. His early years in Europe enriched his work and engendered in him a fascinating versatility of style, ranging from the Dutch and Flemish Old Masters, to Impressionism or the freshness of English Realism. Throughout he displays an integrity of subject constantly enhanced by brilliant effects, harmonious and pleasing to the eye. We also recognise today how skilfully he illuminates the period in which he lived.</p>
